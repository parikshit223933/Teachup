                        Facing the issue of outsiders joining important
                        conferences/meetings and creating a nuisance and
                        disturbing others? Don't worry! We have go you
                        covered. We have our system specially and strictly
                        designed to handle such cases and take down these
                        spammers. With a very strong authentication system
                        we gather a lot of data before authenticating the
                        user at Teachup so that the probability of creating
                        a fake account by any user reduces to its minima.
